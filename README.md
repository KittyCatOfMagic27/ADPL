# ADPL
A Dumb Programming Language written in C++


## Setup ##
Copy the shell commands in the file ADPL.sh into your bash
profile file to use the ADPL commands.

```
usr@penguin:~$ adpl --help
usr@penguin:~$ adpl <file>.adpl
usr@penguin:~$ ./<file>
```

For more information on the adpl command use the help flag.
**Note** that the build and debug flags are for development.


## Documentation ##
All the documentation is in the text files uploaded because
that is where I have been keeping the documentation before 
I had pushed this project to github. I may consider moving
the documentation to this file later on, but I have no idea
how to style in an md file.


## OS ##
This language is built for Debian Linux and compiles to NASM.
Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.


## Future Plans ##
- Make strings more dynamic instead of just a constant.
- Add arrays.
- Add structs (maybe).
- Bug fix and refactor how types are handled.
